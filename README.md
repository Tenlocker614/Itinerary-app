# Itinerary-app
App is mainly based on any kind of travel needs for day-to-day users. Basically, it will enable users to select any state/city/place of interest and it will give info about all the points of interest, activities, and cuisine to try but the main feature of the app is that it'll basically prepare a trip itinerary upon putting dates and give approximate budget based on the number of people, activities they choose, the food they'd eat and of course housing and travel expenses

#Still a work in Progress
